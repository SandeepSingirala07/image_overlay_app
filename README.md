🖼️ Image Overlay App – Description
Image Overlay App is a lightweight, cross-platform desktop application built with PyQt6, designed to display transparent, draggable image overlays on top of your screen. It's ideal for UI designers, developers, presenters, and digital artists who need a quick reference image or overlay while working on other applications.

🎯 Draggable & Resizable Overlay: Position and scale the overlay anywhere on the screen.

🎛️ Minimal Floating Control Panel:

Open Image: Select a new image at any time.

Close: Exit the overlay instantly.

📸 Screenshot Support (Optional): Extendable to show recent screenshots or auto-trigger with the PrintScreen key.

🌐 Cross-Platform Compatible: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux (with Python and PyQt6 installed).
